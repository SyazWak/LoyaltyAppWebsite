## � Introduction for Recruiters

This repository hosts the landing page for my full-stack loyalty architecture project. The ecosystem demonstrates my ability to build unified, secure, and real-time systems across mobile and web platforms.

### What is the SW Loyalty Ecosystem?
The project consists of three interconnected applications working from a single unified logic:

1.  **📱 Customer App**: A premium mobile experience for users to track points and redeem rewards via secure QR codes.
2.  **💼 Staff App**: A high-performance operational portal for shopkeepers to scan customer codes and award points instantly.
3.  **🖥️ Admin Console**: A data-driven command center for business oversight, analytics, and ecosystem management.
